# rpwoodbu's assortment of C++ utilities

These are general-purpose C++ utilities written by me that I use across my
projects. If anyone else finds them useful, go right ahead. They are offered as
a Bazel module, but they are not in the Bazel Central Registry, so you'll need
to use `archive_override()` to bring them in.
